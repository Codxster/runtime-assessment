Xl array
unshift runtime: 1.02 s
push runtime: 4.8 ms

L array 
unshift runtime: 7.2 ms
push runtime: 0.855 ms

M array 
unshift runtime: 220.1 micro s
push runtime: 446.8 micro s

S array 
unshift runtime: 55.3 micro s
push runtime: 119.1 micro s

XS array
unshift runtime: 83.7 micro s
push runtime: 116.0 micro s

The pattern I see is when array sizes are smaller, both functions form at a somewhat comparable speed. As the array size gets larger and larger, the runtime of the function using .unshift becomes larger than the runtime of the function using .push. the .push function scales better. I can tell because as I run larger and larger arrays through the functions, .push's runtime was smaller than .unshift's and the ratio of their times started increasing.
